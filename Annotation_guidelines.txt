Annotation Guidelines for Intent Detection 

Below are the guidelines for annotating queries into five specific categories. 

1. Primary Intent-Only Rule   

Definition: Annotators must label a query based on its primary intent, even if it fits multiple categories.  

Rule: The most actionable or dominant intent determines the category.  

Example: "Your product is amazing, but the app keeps crashing." 
Label as a Technical Issue, since resolving the issue is the actionable intent.


Category Guidelines 

1. Inquiry
   
 Definition: Queries where the user is explicitly seeking information, clarification, or details.  
 
Key Indicators :  
- Use of interrogatives like How, What, Where, etc.  
- No explicit request for action or issue description.  

 Examples :  
- Typical: "How do I track my order?"  
- Ambiguous: "Can I cancel my order?" 
(If asking for steps, label  Information Request; if asking for cancellation directly, label  Request for Action).  


Resolution for Ambiguity: 

Annotate as an Information Request if the primary focus is learning the process. Add a comment if the context is unclear.  


 2. Request for Action   
 
Definition: Queries that involve asking for a specific action or service.  

Key Indicators :  
- Use of imperatives like Please, Do, Cancel, or Change.  
- Describes an action they want the organization to perform.  

 Examples :  
- Typical: "Please cancel my subscription."  
- Ambiguous: "I’d like to know how to cancel my subscription." 

(Label  Information Request if no direct action is requested).  

Resolution for Ambiguity: Consider what the user is expecting the support team to do. Use  Request for Action if action is explicitly desired.  

3. Praise   
Definition: Positive feedback or compliments about products, services, or experiences.  

Key Indicators :  
- Expressions of satisfaction or appreciation.  
- Phrases like Love, Great, Amazing, etc.  

 Examples :  
- Typical: "I’m so happy with your service!" 
- Ambiguous: "Your product is amazing, but I can’t log in." 
(Label as  Technical Issues since resolving the issue is actionable).  

Resolution for Ambiguity: Label  Praise only if the entire query centers on positive feedback. For mixed intent, use actionable categories like  Technical Issues.  

4. Complaint   
Definition: Expressions of dissatisfaction, frustration, or negative experiences.  

Key Indicators :  
- Words like Disappointed, Upset,  or Frustrated.  
- Often seeks acknowledgment but may not request a specific action.  

 Examples :  
- Typical: "I’m unhappy with the late delivery."  
- Ambiguous: "I’m upset about the delay; please refund my money." 

(Label as  Request for Action since a refund is explicitly requested).  

Resolution for Ambiguity: Use  Complaint if the intent is primarily to express dissatisfaction without an explicit call to action.  

5. Technical Issues   

Definition: Queries describing technical malfunctions, errors, or troubleshooting needs.  
 
Key Indicators :  
- Mentions of software, apps, devices, or system behaviours.  
- Words like Error, Crash, or Not working. 

 Examples :  
- Typical: "The app crashes whenever I open it."  
- Ambiguous: "I can’t log in; can you reset my account?" (Label  Request for Action since resetting is explicitly requested).  

Resolution for Ambiguity: Prioritize technical description over accompanying requests. Use  Technical Issues if resolving a malfunction is central.  

Ambiguity and Fallback Rules 

1.  Unclear Queries :  
   - If intent cannot be discerned, mark it as  Unclear and provide a comment explaining why.  
   - Example: "I’m facing issues; help!"  

2.  Multiple Categories :  
 - If a query fits more than one category, follow the  Primary Intent-Only Rule :
 -  Technical Issues > Request for Action > Complaint > Account Inquiry > Information Request > Praise   

3.  Short or Vague Queries :  
   - Use context when available. If not possible, label it as  Unclear.
